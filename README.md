I checked the effect of the log transformer on my data. Log transformation is particularly useful when the data has a highly skewed distribution. By applying a log transformation, the data becomes more normally distributed, which can enhance the performance of various statistical models and algorithms. Log transformation is commonly used when dealing with data that spans several orders of magnitude or when the relationship between variables is multiplicative rather than additive. This transformation helps stabilize variance and make patterns in the data more interpretable. Reciprocal transform is useful for handling data with large values, effectively compressing the range, while power transform is employed to stabilize variance and make the data more Gaussian-like.
